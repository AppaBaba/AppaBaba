Ok, So I have been retired for some time now, but I steel like to code and resolve problems. I guess the reason why is because it seems like it has been one big expanding hobby.  In junior High I had an electronics hobby and by the time I got to High School, I was deep into Digital Stuff. When I was work in avionics and electronics, I had a microcomputer hobby. During this time, I help a lot of people to get started in microcomputers. I put together many micro systems for me and others. I was lucky enough to work with a group of Engineers as an Electronics Technical Engineer interfacing circuits to Automatic Testing Equipment (ATE). I help make circuits and programmed to make them work with the ATE. Also, debugged very large programs that some of the Engineers wrote.  The second half of my correa, I was a Computer Equipment Analyst  and Computer Software Analyst.
